# Revenue Streams

## Primary Revenue Sources

### 1. Protocol Fees

**0.1% annual AUM fee** on all funds

```
Year 3: $5B AUM × 0.1% = $5M/year
```

### 2. Performance Fee Cut

**2% of FM performance fees**

FMs charge 10-20% performance fees → Protocol takes 2%

```
Year 3: Avg $100M profits × 15% FM fee × 2% protocol cut = $300K/year
```

### 3. TOSS Token Appreciation

FM and investor staking demand drives token value
