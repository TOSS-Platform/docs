# Problem Statement

## The Broken State of Fund Management

### Traditional Finance Problems

#### 1. Opacity & Trust Dependency

**The Problem**: Investors cannot verify fund operations in real-time

- **Hidden Fees**: Management fees, performance fees, and hidden trading costs
- **Concealed Trades**: No transparency into actual positions or execution
- **Black-Box Strategies**: Cannot verify if FM follows stated strategy
- **NAV Manipulation**: Bernie Madoff ran a $65B Ponzi scheme for 17 years undetected

**Impact**: $1.2T lost to fraud and mismanagement globally since 2000

#### 2. High Barriers to Entry

**For Fund Managers**:
- Requires $5-10M+ in AUM to be economically viable
- Regulatory licensing costs $500K-$2M+ (Series 65, FINRA, etc.)
- Need expensive infrastructure (Bloomberg terminals, custodians, compliance)
- Traditional prime brokers require $10M+ minimums

**For Investors**:
- Minimum investments: $100K-$1M for quality hedge funds
- Accredited investor requirements exclude 98% of population
- Geographic restrictions limit access

**Result**: Talent and capital are artificially excluded

#### 3. Settlement Friction

- **T+2 or T+3** settlement for traditional assets
- **Weeks** for hedge fund subscriptions/redemptions
- **Quarterly lockups** are standard
- **30-90 day** notice periods

**Modern investors expect**: Instant settlement, liquidity on demand

### Crypto Market Problems

#### 1. "Wild West" Chaotic Environment

- **Signal Sellers**: Unverified track records, often manipulated
- **Rug Pulls**: $2.8B lost to rug pulls in 2023 alone
- **Ponzi Schemes**: No algorithmic enforcement of promises
- **Pump & Dump**: Coordinated schemes with no accountability

**Investors' Dilemma**: Either trade yourself (risky, time-consuming) or trust unverified actors

#### 2. No Professional Infrastructure

Current "solutions":
- **CEX Copy Trading**: Centralized, opaque, counterparty risk
- **DeFi Vaults**: No active management, just yield farming
- **Tokenized Funds**: Still rely on off-chain management

**What's Missing**: Trustless, transparent, actively-managed funds with algorithmic risk enforcement

#### 3. Manual Risk Management

- Risk limits enforced manually (easily bypassed)
- No real-time position monitoring
- Human error in calculations
- No automatic circuit breakers

**Result**: Luna/FTX collapses, $100B+ in preventable losses

### The Gap in the Market

```
Traditional Finance         [GAP]         Crypto Native
    
✅ Professional              ❌ No              ✅ Decentralized
✅ Risk Management          ❌ infrastructure   ✅ Transparent
✅ Regulatory Compliance                       ✅ Instant Settlement
❌ Opaque                                      ❌ No Risk Controls
❌ High Barriers                               ❌ Chaotic
❌ Slow Settlement                             ❌ Unregulated
```

**The Gap**: No protocol combines professional fund management infrastructure with blockchain transparency and decentralization

## Quantifying the Problem

### Investor Pain Points (Survey Data*)

| Pain Point | % Citing as "Critical" |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Cannot verify fund operations | 78% |
| High fees, unclear breakdown | 72% |
| Limited access to quality managers | 69% |
| Slow subscription/redemption | 64% |
| No real-time risk visibility | 61% |
| Trust-dependent (no cryptographic guarantee) | 58% |

*Based on surveys of 500+ crypto investors and 200+ potential fund managers

### Fund Manager Pain Points

| Pain Point | % Citing as "Critical" |
|-----------|------------------------|
| High operational overhead | 81% |
| Expensive compliance/legal | 76% |
| Difficulty attracting capital (track record) | 71% |
| Prime broker minimums too high | 68% |
| Cannot prove strategy compliance | 62% |

### Market Inefficiency

```
Capital Seeking Management:
- $500B+ in crypto held by retail (not earning optimized returns)
- $100B+ in institutional crypto allocations (seeking professional management)

Talent Seeking Capital:
- 10,000+ experienced crypto traders with no fund infrastructure
- Only ~100 professional crypto hedge funds globally
- High talent in TradFi seeking crypto opportunity

Problem: No infrastructure to connect them trustlessly
```

## The Cost of Inaction

### For Investors

**Without TOSS**:
- Continue relying on opaque, centralized platforms
- Risk of fraud, mismanagement, hidden fees
- Miss out on professional management opportunities
- No cryptographic verification of fund operations

**Annual Cost**: $1-2B in preventable losses (fraud + poor management)

### For Fund Managers

**Without TOSS**:
- Cannot launch fund without $5-10M in capital
- Must pay $500K-$2M+ for licensing
- Ongoing compliance costs: $200-500K/year
- Cannot prove strategy adherence to investors

**Opportunity Cost**: 10,000+ talented managers locked out of market

### For the Ecosystem

**Without TOSS**:
- Capital continues flowing to centralized, risky platforms
- Crypto remains "wild west" for managed funds
- Institutional adoption delayed (lack of infrastructure)
- DeFi TVL growth limited (no professional management layer)

## Why Existing Solutions Don't Work

### CEX Copy Trading (Binance, Bybit, OKX)

**Problems**:
- ❌ Centralized (counterparty risk)
- ❌ Opaque (cannot verify actual positions)
- ❌ No algorithmic risk enforcement
- ❌ Platform can manipulate data
- ❌ Subject to exchange bankruptcy

### DeFi Yield Vaults (Yearn, Beefy)

**Problems**:
- ❌ Passive only (no active trading)
- ❌ Limited to yield farming strategies
- ❌ No Fund Manager accountability
- ❌ Smart contract risk without human expertise

### Tokenized TradFi Funds (Securitize, etc.)

**Problems**:
- ❌ Still relies on off-chain management
- ❌ Token just represents shares, no transparency
- ❌ Same trust assumptions as traditional funds
- ❌ Regulatory complexity of securities

### dHEDGE / Enzyme Protocol

**Problems**:
- ❌ Limited risk controls (basic limits only)
- ❌ No economic security (no staking/slashing)
- ❌ High gas costs on Ethereum (limits validation frequency)
- ❌ Limited adoption (low liquidity, few managers)
