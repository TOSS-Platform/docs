# Tokenomics

## TOSS Token

**Total Supply**: 1,000,000,000 TOSS (fixed, non-mintable)

## Token Utility

### 1. Fund Manager Collateral

Required stake: 10,000+ TOSS based on fund size

```
FM Stake = BaseStake + (AUM × 0.1%)
```

### 2. Investor Staking

| Class | Stake Required | Benefits |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| Retail | 100 TOSS | Tier 1-2 access |
| Premium | 1,000 TOSS | Tier 1-3 + 10% discount |
| Institutional | 10,000 TOSS | All tiers + 25% discount |
| Strategic | 100,000 TOSS | All + voting power |
